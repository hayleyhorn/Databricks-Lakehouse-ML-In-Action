# Chapter 2: Designing Databricks Day One

**Here is what you will learn as part of this chapter:**

1. Planning your Lakehouse 
2. Leading with business value 
3. Applying our learning

## Technical requirements 

Here are the technical requirements needed to complete the hands-on examples in this chapter:
- We utilize a Python package, opendatasets, to download the data we need from the Kaggle API with ease: [opendatasets](https://pypi.org/project/opendatasets/)
- To use the Kaggle API, you must download your credential file, kaggle.json. [Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api)
- A GitHub account is very helpful for connecting Databricks and the code repository for the book: [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- In addition to a GitHub account, it is ideal to fork the book repository into your GitHub account: [Databricks Lakehouse ML in Action repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Databricks-Lakehouse-ML-In-Action)
- [Databricks Secrets API](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html)
- [What is the Databricks CLI?](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/index.html)
- [Install or update the Databricks CLI]( https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html)
- You will need to download the Tensorlite wheel from Kaggle to get the specific version used in competition: [Tensorlite wheel](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/philculliton/tflite-wheels-2140)
